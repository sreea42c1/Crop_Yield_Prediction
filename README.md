# Crop_Yield_Prediction_Using_Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning–based predictive model to estimate future crop yield using historical agricultural and environmental data. The model analyzes factors such as rainfall, temperature, pesticide usage, and year to predict crop production. The focus of this project is on model reasoning and explainability, not just achieving high accuracy.

🎯 Problem Statement
Build a predictive model using a real or public dataset to predict a future value and explain the results. In this project, a crop yield dataset is used to predict future crop yield values based on past trends and environmental conditions.
