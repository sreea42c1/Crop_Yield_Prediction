# Crop_Yield_Prediction_Using_Machine Learning
🌾 Crop Yield Prediction using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning–based predictive model to estimate future crop yield using historical agricultural and environmental data. The model analyzes factors such as rainfall, temperature, pesticide usage, and year to predict crop production.
The focus of this project is on model reasoning and explainability, not just achieving high accuracy.
